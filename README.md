# Find_Best_fit_Polynomial

- This is a project about reading a data and determine the best fit polynomial by using polynomial regression's math. Only the foundation libraries of Python are used.

- The first script which has "vize" in its name determines the best fit polynomial degrees from 1-6 by the correlation coefficient and the results are written in "sonuc_vize.txt" in Turkish.

- The second which has "final" in its name determines the best fit polynomial degrees and it has been transformed into a function to calculate the integral of the equation without any libraries for integral and the results are written in "180401026_yorum.txt".
