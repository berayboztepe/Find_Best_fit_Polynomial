# Find_Best_fit_Polynomial

- This was my assignment for Scientific Calculation class during my bachelors.
  
- This is a project about reading a data and determine the best fit polynomial by using polynomial regression's math. Only the foundation libraries of Python are used.

- The first script which has "vize" in its name determines the best fit polynomial degrees from 1-6 by the correlation coefficient and the results are written in "sonuc_vize.txt" in Turkish. You can also check english version. [Python](180401026_vize_en.py), [result](https://github.com/berayboztepe/Find_Best_fit_Polynomial/blob/main/result_vize_en.txt)

- The second which has "final" in its name determines the best fit polynomial degrees and it has been transformed into a function to calculate the integral of the equation without any libraries for integral and the results are written in "180401026_yorum.txt". English version: [Python](180401026_final_en.py), [result](180401026-comment_en.txt)
