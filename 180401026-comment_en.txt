The smaller the deltax (width of the rectangles), the closer the computed value is to the actual value.
This is because we find the integral by dividing the polynomial into small rectangles and summing their areas.
So, the smaller deltax is, the more accurate the value becomes, though it takes longer to compute.
However, the difference between the two integrals is not primarily due to deltax,
but because the first integral approximates the polynomial to a certain correlation coefficient.
Thus, even with the same deltax values, the results differ.
